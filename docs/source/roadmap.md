# Planned features

We aim to incorporate the following features into pyRBM. 

Where existing solutions and libraries exist, we will intergrate these into pyRBM (possibly as an optional package).


##  Simulation management features

Save and load parameter sets for a model.

Attach meta data to a saved trajectory - parameter set, time series used?, model name/version.

## More trajectory features

Saving resolution, save trajectory to file, save final state to file, save certain times to file.

## Triggerable events and Timestepping Gillespie



## Data - static time series


## Create locations and rules from files


## Mixed (determanistic) rules and solvers for them



## Tau-Leaping and associated algorithms



## Multiple simulations - distributions, parallelisation and efficencies



## Example models - chemical reactions, epidemology,  economic


## Unit Tests


## Parameter estimation techniques and SINDy


## User interface for model creation (stretch)


## User interface for simulation management (stretch)
